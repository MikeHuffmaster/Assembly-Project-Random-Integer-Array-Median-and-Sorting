## Description
The user will be introduced to the program. This program will create a list of 200 random integers in the range of 15 to 50. The program will then display the median, the sorted list in ascending order, and the count of each number in the list.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Assemble the assembly code using an x86 assembler (e.g., MASM).
3. Execute the resulting binary to run the program.

## Code Structure
- **main.asm**: Main program file.
- **Irvine32.inc**: Irvine32 library for assembly programming.

## How to Run
1. Assemble the main.asm file using your preferred x86 assembler.
2. Run the generated executable.

## Code Overview
- **Introduction**: Introduces the purpose of the program to the user.
- **Fill Array**: Generates a list of 200 random integers between 15 and 50.
- **Display List**: Displays the initial array with 20 numbers per line.
- **Sort List**: Sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
- **Exchange Elements**: Swaps two elements in the array.
- **Display Median**: Calculates and displays the median of the array.
- **Count List**: Counts the occurrences of each number in the array and displays the counts.

## Note
This project uses the Irvine32 library for assembly programming. Ensure that the library is properly linked during the assembly process.
